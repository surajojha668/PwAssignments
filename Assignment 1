What is a Computer?
A computer is an electronic device that can perform various tasks by executing instructions given to it. It consists of hardware components such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, input devices, and output devices. These components work together to process and manipulate data.
 
What is RAM?
RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It is a type of computer memory that provides temporary storage for data that is actively being used by the CPU. RAM allows the computer to quickly access and store data, which enhances the system's performance. When the computer is powered off, the data stored in RAM is erased.

Where is data stored in a computer?
Hard Disk Drive (HDD): This is a magnetic storage device that provides long-term storage for programs and data even when the computer is turned off.

Data is stored in a computer in different locations depending on its type and purpose. The main types of storage in a computer are:
Solid-State Drive (SSD): Similar to an HDD, an SSD is also used for long-term storage. It uses flash memory instead of magnetic disks, resulting in faster access times and better performance.
RAM: As mentioned earlier, RAM provides temporary storage for data that the computer is actively using. It is volatile memory, meaning the data is lost when the computer is powered off.
External Storage Devices: Computers can also utilize external storage devices such as USB drives, external hard drives, or cloud storage services to store and retrieve data.

What is that input device used to type text and numbers on a document in the computer system?
The input device used to type text and numbers on a document in the computer system is typically a keyboard. Keyboards come in various forms, including traditional physical keyboards and virtual keyboards on touchscreens.

What are the output devices?
Output devices are used to display or present data processed by the computer. Some common output devices include:
Monitor or Display: It shows visual output, such as text, images, videos, and graphical user interfaces.
Printer: It produces hard copies of documents or images on paper.
Speakers: They provide audio output, allowing the computer to play sounds, music, or other audio files.
Projector: It projects the computer's display onto a larger screen or surface, often used for presentations or multimedia purposes.

Which is the input device that allows a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen?
The input device that allows a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen is typically a mouse. The mouse has a physical or optical sensor underneath that detects motion and translates it into movement on the screen.

Which language is directly understood by the computer without a translation program?
The language that is directly understood by the computer without a translation program is known as machine language or binary code. Machine language uses a series of binary digits (0s and 1s) to represent instructions and data that the computer can execute directly.

What are Input devices?
Input devices are peripherals or devices used to provide data or commands to a computer. They allow users to interact with the computer system and input information. Some common input devices include:
Keyboard: Used to enter text, numbers, and commands into the computer.
Mouse: Allows users to control the movement of the cursor on the screen and make selections.
Touchscreen: A display that can detect touch input, allowing users to interact directly with the screen using their fingers or a stylus.
Scanner: Used to convert physical documents, images, or objects into digital format by scanning them.
Microphone: Captures audio input, allowing users to record sounds or provide voice commands to the computer.
Webcam: Captures video input, typically used for video conferencing or recording videos.
Joystick/Gamepad: Input devices primarily used for gaming, providing control over movements and actions in games.
Digital Camera: Allows users to capture still images and videos digitally, which can be transferred to a computer for further processing.
These are just a few examples of input devices, and there are many more specialized input devices available for specific purposes or industries.
